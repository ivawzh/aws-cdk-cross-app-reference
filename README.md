# cdk-playground

Example of cross-cdk-app-repo importing.

This is a spike of idea described in https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/7721

## Plan 1 - multiple CDK apps

At the moment, infrastructure deployments works as expected. Service-A deployment throws error:

```log
Error: Cannot reference across apps. Consuming and producing stacks must be defined within the same CDK app.

```

## Plan 2 - CDK app injection

One CDK app, multiple registers.
Each individual repo has its own register. Register provisions one or more stacks.

All deployments work ðŸ¤Ÿ

Downsides:

1. service repo can deploy stack from infrastructure repo, e.g. `cdk deploy SqsStack` while I am at service repo. Cannot use `  Tag.add(app, 'project', projectName); Tag.add(app, 'app', appName)` in consumer stacks, because that will apply the tag name to all shared infra stacks.
2. have to publish provider and re-npm-install at consumer to keep things up-to-date.

These downsides could be slightly mitigated by npm script, e.g. `"deploy": "npm install && cdk deploy TopicStack"`.
